### Overview and Origin

Betterment is a an investment and wealth management platform that was founded in 2008 in New York City by Eli Broverman and Jon Stein. Betterment Holdings, Inc., Betterment's parent company, was incorporated in Delaware on January 29, 2008. [[1]](https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/Ecorp/EntitySearch/NameSearch.aspx) [[2]](https://sec.report/CIK/0001633901) It is possible that Betterment can fall under three different fintech domains: investment management, wealth management, and robo-advising. For the putposes of this case study, I will be examining Betterment under the robo-advising domain.

After completing his MBA at Columbia Business School in 2009 and working for four years at a consulting firm, Stein wanted to move on and start his own company. After opening up multiple investment accounts, he was looking for a platform that was personalized to him and not to the big banks, but there was nothing like that available yet. He recruited his "then-roommate Sean Owen who was a Google engineer who helped with the back-end of the system, Eli Broverman, a securities lawyer who helped with regulatory, and Ryan O'Sullivan who had broker-dealer expertise."

Its technology enables users to manage their investments in a customized, diversified portfolio. Charging a management fee of 0.25%, the company enables users to access, view, share, and review their portfolioâ€™s activities as well as deposit and withdraw money from anywhere, anytime. Betterment's products also include Tax Loss Harvesting, a program that works to offset taxes on both gains and income; and RetireGuide, a series of online surveys to enable users to determine the success of their long-term financial goals."

At the end of 2021, Betterment raised an additional $160 million in funding, bringing its total raised to $435 million, with a current valuation of $1.3 billion.
