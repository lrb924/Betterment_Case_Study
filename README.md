### Overview and Origin

Betterment is a an investment and wealth management platform that was founded on August 25, 2008 in New York City by Eli Broverman and Jon Stein.

After completing his MBA at Columbia Business School in 2009 and working for four years at a consulting firm, Stein wanted to move on and start his own company. He recruited his "then-roommate Sean Owen who was a Google engineer who helped with the back-end of the system, Eli Broverman, a securities lawyer who helped with regulatory, and Ryan O'Sullivan who had broker-dealer expertise."
