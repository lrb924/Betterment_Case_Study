## Betterment

"Making people's
lives better. Our mission is to help people turn everyday investments, no matter how small, into their dreams, no matter how big." [[1](https://www.betterment.com/about)]

### Overview and Origin

Betterment is a an investment and wealth management platform that was founded in 2008 in New York City by Eli Broverman and Jon Stein. Betterment Holdings, Inc., Betterment's parent company, was incorporated in Delaware on January 29, 2008. [[1]](https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/Ecorp/EntitySearch/NameSearch.aspx) [[2]](https://sec.report/CIK/0001633901) It is possible that Betterment can fall under three different fintech domains: investment management, wealth management, and robo-advising. For the putposes of this case study, I will be examining Betterment under the robo-advising domain.

After completing his MBA at Columbia Business School in 2009 and working for four years at a consulting firm, Stein wanted to move on and start his own company. He realized that all of the investment accounts he opened after college were not personalized to his needs and goals, and Stein was looking for a platform that would do that, but there was nothing like that available yet. He recruited his "then-roommate Sean Owen who was a Google engineer who helped with the back-end of the system, Eli Broverman, a securities lawyer who helped with regulatory, and Ryan O'Sullivan who had broker-dealer expertise."

Its technology enables users to manage their investments in a customized, diversified portfolio. Charging a management fee of 0.25%, the company enables users to access, view, share, and review their portfolio’s activities as well as deposit and withdraw money from anywhere, anytime. Betterment's products also include Tax Loss Harvesting, a program that works to offset taxes on both gains and income; and RetireGuide, a series of online surveys to enable users to determine the success of their long-term financial goals."

At the end of 2021, Betterment raised an additional $160 million in funding, bringing its total raised to $435 million, with a current valuation of $1.3 billion. [[1]](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/betterment-series-f-funding/)

### Business Activities

Betterment was founded because there was nothing in the marketplace that would automate the investment process and use AI technology to help the investor ultimately decide what was best for them. Their audience is investors that want to avoid the sometimes arduous task of finding exchange-traded funds that meet their investment goals. Instead, after taking a quick quiz, Betterment's robo-advising platform automatically matches your investment profile and goals with an appropriate portfolio. Additionally, the platform will automatically rebalance the portfolio in order to stay on track with the established goals. [[1]](https://www.betterment.com/how-it-works) Betterment currently offers two different service options: Betterment Digital and Betterment Premium. Betterment Digital is the robo-advising side of the company, and Betterment Premium offers "unlimited phone access to ceritied financial planners... and a $100,000 account minimum." Betterment Digital's account minimum is only $10.00.

"Betterment’s asset allocation is based on a theory by economist Harry Markowitz called Modern Portfolio Theory." [[1]](https://www.betterment.com/resources/betterment-portfolio-strategy)

### Landscape

Betterment is one of the two most popular robo-advising platforms on the market. Their main competitor is Wealthfront, which essentially does the same thing. After the financial crisis in 2008, which eventually led to Betterment's founding, the robo-advising domain has expanded. The main benefits of robo-advising platforms are the following: automation, lows fees and cost-effectiveness, customized portfolio management, flexibility and adaptability, remote operation, easy customer on-boarding, minimal capital to initialize, and 24/7 operation.
