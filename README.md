## Betterment

"Making people's
lives better. Our mission is to help people turn everyday investments, no matter how small, into their dreams, no matter how big." [[1](https://www.betterment.com/about)]

### Overview and Origin

Betterment is a an investment and wealth management platform that was founded in 2008 in New York City by Eli Broverman and Jon Stein. Betterment Holdings, Inc., Betterment's parent company, was incorporated in Delaware on January 29, 2008. [[2]](https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/Ecorp/EntitySearch/NameSearch.aspx) [[3]](https://sec.report/CIK/0001633901) It is possible that Betterment can fall under three different fintech domains: investment management, wealth management, and robo-advising. For the putposes of this case study, I will be examining Betterment under the robo-advising domain. According to Morningstar's 2022 Robo-Advisor Landscape report, "[t]he birth of robo-advisors reflects the confluence of many trends, including the growth of the internet,
the surge in popularity of ETFs and other low-cost investment options, the waning of defined-benefit
pension plans, generally rising investor affluence, and a flood of private equity assets looking for
disruptive players in financial technology." [[4]](https://assets.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt4eb669caa7dc65b2/blted6644c10a450f00/62a107712680af59223324ba/Robo-Advisor_Landscape-2022.pdf)

After completing his MBA at Columbia Business School in 2009 and working for four years at a consulting firm, Stein wanted to move on and start his own company. He realized that all of the investment accounts he opened after college were not personalized to his needs and goals, and Stein was looking for a platform that would do that, but there was nothing like that available yet. He recruited his "then-roommate Sean Owen who was a Google engineer who helped with the back-end of the system, Eli Broverman, a securities lawyer who helped with regulatory, and Ryan O'Sullivan who had broker-dealer expertise." [[5](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2017/04/26/growing-at-300-to-8-5-billion-betterment-offers-fee-tax-edge/?sh=29d470b73ff3)] Today, Betterment is described by Crunchbase as "a smart automated investing service that provides optimized investment returns for individual, IRA, ROTH IRA, and rollover 401(k) accounts. Its technology enables users to manage their investments in a customized, diversified portfolio. Charging a management fee of 0.25%, the company enables users to access, view, share, and review their portfolio’s activities as well as deposit and withdraw money from anywhere, anytime. Betterment's products also include Tax Loss Harvesting, a program that works to offset taxes on both gains and income; and RetireGuide, a series of online surveys to enable users to determine the success of their long-term financial goals." [[6](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/betterment)]

At the end of 2021, Betterment raised an additional $160 million in funding, bringing its total raised to $435 million, with a current valuation of $1.3 billion. [[7]](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/betterment-series-f-funding/)

### Business Activities

Betterment was founded because there was nothing in the marketplace that would automate the investment process and use AI technology (in the form of algorithms) to help the investor ultimately decide what was best for them. Their audience is investors that want to avoid the sometimes arduous task of finding exchange-traded funds that meet their investment goals on their own. This audience is especially comprised of younger (especially Millennials and Gen-Z) investors that do not want to pay exorbitant management fees that traditional financial advisors charge (~1% compared to the ~0.30% of robo-advising platforms) and desire the autonomy (outside of the AI technology) to make investment decisions based on data. [[8]](https://assets.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt4eb669caa7dc65b2/blted6644c10a450f00/62a107712680af59223324ba/Robo-Advisor_Landscape-2022.pdf) Instead of working with a traditional advisor, Betterment clients take a quick quiz, and then Betterment's robo-advising platform automatically matches your investment profile and goals with an appropriate portfolio. Additionally, the platform will automatically rebalance the portfolio in order to stay on track with the established goals. [[9]](https://www.betterment.com/how-it-works) "Betterment’s asset allocation is based on a theory by economist Harry Markowitz called Modern Portfolio Theory." [[12]](https://www.betterment.com/resources/betterment-portfolio-strategy Betterment currently offers two different service options: Betterment Digital and Betterment Premium. Betterment Digital is the robo-advising side of the company, and Betterment Premium offers "unlimited phone access to ceritied financial planners... and a $100,000 account minimum." Betterment Digital's account minimum is only $10.00.

### Landscape

Betterment is one of the two most popular robo-advising platforms on the market. Their main competitor is Wealthfront, which essentially does the same thing. After the financial crisis in 2008, which eventually led to Betterment's founding, the robo-advising domain has expanded, and "[a]ssets under management in the robo-advisors segment are projected to reach $1.79 trillion in 2022." [[13]](https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/fintech/digital-investment/robo-advisors/worldwide) The main benefits of robo-advising platforms are the following: automation, lows fees and cost-effectiveness, customized portfolio management, flexibility and adaptability, remote operation, easy customer on-boarding, minimal capital to initialize, and 24/7 operation. [[14]](https://dashdevs.com/blog/fintech-robo-advisors-invasion-menace-or-opportunities-copy/) Over the past 5-10 years, the technology has gotten sleeker and the ability to manipulate data and gain more information has become more sopphisticated. As a result, algorithms have gotten smarter and been adapated to make more informed investment decisions. Other companies in the robo-advising domain include SoFi Invest, Ally Invest, and Blooom, among others. Wealthsimple was a previous competitor, however, Betterment bought their U.S. business in 2021. 

### Results

As of September 2021, Betterment has $33 billion in assets under management and almost 700,000 customer accounts. [[15]](https://www.investopedia.com/betterment-enters-crypto-with-makara-acquisition-5218550) These numbers have grown significantly over the years, and I think this is the point where they measure success. It is more likely than not that companies like Betterment are spending more on their customer acquisition costs than technology costs, and these assets under management and customer account numbers demonstrate that. Additionally, overall "[t]he number of new robo-advisor account holders in the U.S. grew by 37.4% during 2020, which was 13.7 percentage points higher than the 2019 growth rate, per an Insider Intelligence forecast." [[16]](https://www.emarketer.com/content/betterment-hits-unicorn-status-following-160m-raise) Betterment is the type of company that has the platform to gain an untapped audience and get inexperienced investors interested in the market. Its easy-to-use platform makes it very simple. Morningstar also ranked Betterment the second-best robo-advising platform available to investors today. Compared to its competitors, Betterment has remained independent, while it's main competitor, Wealthfront, was recently bought by UBS Group for $1.4 billion. [[17]](https://www.ubs.com/global/en/media/display-page-ndp/en-20220126-wealthfront.html). A recent S&P report valued Betterment at approximately $1.3 billion and predicts it could be a target for larger firms. "Betterment's AUM stood at $32 billion as of September 2021, whereas Wealthfront's was roughly $27 billion as of the merger announcement. Betterment received a $1.3 billion valuation in a September 2021 funding round." [[18]](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/research/wealthfronts-14b-sale-could-prompt-betterment-acorns-to-consider-selling)

### Recommendations

If I were to advise Betterment, I would suggest they keep increasing the capabilities of their technology. In order to keep customer growth on a strong trajectory, it needs to constantly work on improving the technology in order to make the best investment decisions for investors. Something that another competitor, Ellevest, does is focus their platform on female investors. Particularly, one of their model adjustments is related to a female's longer life expectancy compared to males. [[19]](https://www.investopedia.com/ellevest-vs-betterment-4706029) Additionally, according to Fidenlity's 2021 Women and Investing Study, "women outperform men by 40 basis points, or 0.4%, on average." [[20]](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/11/op-ed-heres-why-women-are-better-investors-than-men.html) Focusing on women investors and adjusting algorithms based on research such as this, could even increase Betterment's revenue in addition to the investors.
